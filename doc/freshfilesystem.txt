系统重启需要刷新文件缓存到磁盘
原理：通过修改proc系统的 drop_caches 来清理 free 的 cache
这些命令也可以释放较多的内存
Writing to this will cause the kernel to drop clean caches, dentries and inodes from memory, causing that memory to become free.
To free pagecache:
* echo 1 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches
To free dentries and inodes:
* echo 2 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches
To free pagecache, dentries and inodes:
* echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches
As this is a non-destructive operation, and dirty objects are notfreeable, the user should run “sync” first in order to make sure allcached objects are freed.
This tunable was added in 2.6.16.
system("sync");
system("echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches");
通过刷新缓存后，读取的就是实时的硬盘数据了。
